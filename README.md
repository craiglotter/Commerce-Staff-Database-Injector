Commerce-Staff-Database-Injector
================================

All Commerce websites now use a single Access database to generate their staff listing pages off. In order to speed up the manual process of putting all information into the database, one record at a time, Commerce Staff Database Injector parses a specially formatted text file and injects the records directly into the database.
